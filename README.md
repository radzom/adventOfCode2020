Solutions in [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/) to the advent calendar problems from [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020)

## Setup

There are several ways to run the programs.

### In the Browser

By far the easiest way without the need to install anything is using [Klipse](https://github.com/viebel/klipse)

Here is the Link to the [Clojure(Script) Browser REPL](http://app.klipse.tech/)

### In the Terminal

You need to have [node](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

Then just install [Lumo](http://lumo-cljs.org/)

```sh
npm install -g lumo-cljs
```

Then you can run the programs on your commandline

```sh
lumo 01.cljs
```
